# Car Assembly 

Why the car?
The base vehicle originated about the same time as the DonkeyCar project. With the design difference that a microntroller was used to off load the real time components of the vehicle to a microcontroller. Then benifits is that the car can be controlled and stopped safely without the main computer needing to intervene. Addditionaly, the signals communication motion to the vehicle are passed so quickly from driver to vehcile there is virtually no delay. We interfaces and console joysticks are good features but were awkward to use. Since all these projects are evolving each area is getting better.

This car uses a custom Teensy PCB adapter. Also, a custom Pi Hat. Additionally, it repalces the NiMH battery power with a LiPO based system. Also, the battery elminator circuit manages the power for the PI and the electronics off of one main batter.


What is the car?

The Foocar is a self contained machine learning capable vehicle. The design is scalable from small servo robots all the way to farming robots. This scalability is one of the main features. If you want to race bigger cars like Power Wheels or creating cutom fariming robots this project is for you.
